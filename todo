no need to store newline in tmp files, this saves EOL extra bytes per word
more seperation of concern and clean up code
type bound checking for input
use insertion sort under cutoff optimization for merge
sort method with optimal parameters for the input file (check newline for the lineSizeBytes)
linux better file handling (maybe close after reading a file)
remove all platform layer stuff from FileSort and have platform specific files for implementations instead of using directives
compression of lines..
