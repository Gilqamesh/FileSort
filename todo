no need to store newline in tmp files, this saves EOL extra bytes per word
more seperation of concern and clean up code
fileManager's createTmp method should take in index of tmp file because of how vector<uin32> chunkCopyDirection is set up
generate test files and maybe tester for them
type bound checking for input
cutoff for merge
sort method with optimal parameters for the input file (check newline for the lineSizeBytes)
clean up includes and unused stuff
